comment: While Link is on vacation, a new hero takes over! Meet Linka, a cute and courageous girl from a faraway region. Not to be confused with Linkle. Comes with a custom boat, the Queen of White Swans, and has an alternate hammer, the Stalfos Hammer, available on GameBanana. If you want gloves, I recommend recoloring her hands to match the bracers!
